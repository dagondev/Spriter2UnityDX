# Spriter2UnityDX
Converts Spriter .scml files to Unity prefabs

Version 1.0.2

Download the Unity Package here: https://github.com/Dharengo/Spriter2UnityDX/raw/master/Packages/Spriter2UnityDX.unitypackage

!!!Requires Unity 5.x!!!

Use Instructions:

1) Import the package into your Unity project (just drag and drop it into your Project view).<br>
2) Import your entire Spriter project folder (including all the textures) into your Unity project<br>
3) The converter should automatically create a prefab (with nested animations) and an AnimatorController<br>
4) When you make any changes to the .scml file, the converter will attempt to update existing assets if they exist<br>
5) If the update causes irregular behaviour, try deleting the original assets and then reimporting the .scml file
